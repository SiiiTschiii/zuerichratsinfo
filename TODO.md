# Project TODOs

- [x] Initial setup
  - Create GitHub repo
  - Set up Go project structure
  - First version that fetches data from PARIS API and posts to X
- [x] Automate with GitHub Actions
  - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run the bot on a schedule (e.g., hourly or daily) and post to X automatically.
- [ ] Define first real use case
  - Decide what type of council business to post (e.g., only Motions, or all new submissions) and when to post (immediately, daily summary, etc.).
- [ ] Tag relevant X accounts
  - Enhance the bot to tag relevant Gemeinderat X accounts in posts, based on author/submitter.
- [ ] Generate visual posts (images)
  - Create simple image posts with text on colored backgrounds (varying colors per post, add shadows)
  - This would enable expansion to visual-first platforms like Instagram and TikTok
  - Start simple: uni-colored background + large text + basic shadow effects
- [ ] Design a Logo for the x.com account
- [ ] Write a transparent X account description
  - Draft a clear, trustworthy profile description for @zuerichratsinfo on X
  - Explain that all information is sourced from the official Zurich City Council (https://www.gemeinderat-zuerich.ch/)
  - Link to the open-source code repository
  - Target audience: regional politicians and Zurich citizens (not tech-savvy)
  - Use simple, direct language to build trust and transparency
