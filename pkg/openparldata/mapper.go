// vote they are not: Nein is structurally always 0, because there is no Nein to
// cast. Every cantonal quorum vote therefore derived as "Ja" — including one

// vote passed depends on a threshold that no source we read publishes, and that
// differs by which procedure the vote serves, which type_de does not say.
